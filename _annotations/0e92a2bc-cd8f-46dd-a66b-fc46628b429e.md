In contrast to Christ’s ascent to heaven, the opposite panel depicts the pope’s descent into hell. Instead of being welcomed by angels, the pope is being cast into hellfire by monstrous demons. Such a dramatic image accompanies the description of the defeat of the cosmic beast of Revelation 19 and its false prophet: 

And the beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who in its presence had done the signs by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped its image. These two were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur. And the rest were slain by the sword that came from the mouth of him who was sitting on the horse, and all the birds were gorged with their flesh (Revelation 19:20-21). 

A final passage describing the defeat of Christ’s adversaries is cited from 2 Thessalonians 2:8: “And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will kill with the breath of his mouth and bring to nothing by the appearance of his coming.” Just as this work concludes positively by saying that Christ and his followers will be known throughout time by their humble service, so it affirms that the enemies of God will come to naught, made nothing by the holy breath of God in Christ.
